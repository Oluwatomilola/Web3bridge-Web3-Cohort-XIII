# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
Todolist contract address ``` 0x763d00A9F6124f7b004C08D588d49639f1602748 ```
School Management System contract address ``` 0x717B856A76429d7c70d000b494c062224Daceb8b ```
